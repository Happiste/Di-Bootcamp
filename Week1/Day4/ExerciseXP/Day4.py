# # Exercise 4 : Random
# # Instructions
# # Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100 and generates another number randomly between 1 and 100. Use the random module.
# # Compare the two numbers, if it‚Äôs the same number, display a success message, otherwise show a fail message and display both numbers.
